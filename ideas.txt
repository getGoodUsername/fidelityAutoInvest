track the asset values and their target weights and send a notification
if at the end of a closing day your target weights have shifted so much
that to be able to do a full buy rebalance would go above some threshold
defined by the user.

maybe use selenium grid to allow for parallel orders https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/grid/
if doing parallel buy/sell orders can't be done easily on a single instance
of selenium

Have a different process for sells where the user is more in control
and providing more instruction.
Sells by their nature tend to come with more repercussion if not
careful

When buying always do limit orders that are slightly lower price than
the current ask price. maybe 0.3% less aka 99.7% of current ask price
