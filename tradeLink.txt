https://digital.fidelity.com/ftgw/digital/trade-equity/index?ACCOUNT=[accountID *redacted just in case*]&ORDER_TYPE=E&CURRENT_PAGE=TradeStocks&DEST_TRADE=Y&SYMBOL=VTI

what remains constant:
    ORDER_TYPE=E
    CURRENT_PAGE=TradeStocks
    DEST_TRADE=Y

what is dynamic:
    ACCOUNT=[accountID]
    SYMBOL=VTI

What I think stuff means:
"ORDER_TYPE=E":                             equities can also be =M meaning mutual funds
"CURRENT_PAGE=TradeStocks":                 I think this a redundant version of the above query paramater
"DEST_TRADE=Y":                             no idea... it automatically appears so I am keeping it
ACCOUNT=[accountID]:                        the number associated with a specific account in fidelity, say a ROTH, or after tax account
SYMBOL=VTI:                                 ticker of the equity I want to buy or sell.
