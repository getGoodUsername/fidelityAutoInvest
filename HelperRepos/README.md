# JSArrayCpp
Enhancing std::vector to work more like a java script array. I would like to use map and reduce without all the messiness of std::reduce or std::transform. Yes I inherit std::vector in my new class. Yes, I also don't care. IMO, stuff like this should be already standard with std::vector...

This won't have every method found in a javascript array, mostly just the ones I care about and use often
that also don't have a nice replacement in C++.
